## This is for ease of replication of the issue

To start replication, just add a MongoDB url to the .env file.

For authentication purposes, you can create a user directly into the database; it should look like this:

```json
{
    "id": "AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY MONGODB",
    "name": "username",
    "email": "user@email.com",
    "hashedPassword": "BCRYPT HASH"
    ...
}
```

Or, you can just create a user with the Form component that is provided here in the repo.

If .env is not provided here in the repo, you can copy-paste the following into the .env file:

```js
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000/"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="SECRET"
NEXTAUTH_JWT_SECRET="JWT_SECRET"

DATABASE_URL="INSERT MONGODB URL HERE"
```

## Details of the issue:

Able to sign out ONLY when users sign out from the same page they signed in from. That's pretty much the overview of it. I've tested it for other scenarios and you'll be able to see the result on those pages. 

_Please don't worry about the Form component, the Route Handler, and the dependencies related to it. I've tested the repo with and without it; it has no effect on with the auth issue. It's simply to help with the replication process._
